      <p> Those eager to submit to the whims of the highly intelligent metal overlords in our near future will be pleased to learn that, at long last, a computer has successfully passed the Turing test, effectively tricking a group of pitiful human meat-bags into believing it’s one of them.
      
      The only question remaining is what form the coming age of robotic rule will take. Will highly intelligent computers hook human beings up to fuel cells and feed off the electromagnetic energy coursing through their bodies? Will they create an army of war machines that hunt the few remaining human survivors to the ends of the Earth? Or will they do something entirely unexpected that even the fleshy, pink brains of our finest film directors can’t foresee? </p>
